# OpenGL Depth Peeled Hair

![Screenshot](Screenshot.jpg)

Hair rendered with depth peeling, implemented in OpenGL. 
I've been using this repo as a playground to implement a new asset loading system too, it's easier and faster to work in than my main engine. 
This codebase also contains asynchronous compressed texture loading implemented with Pixel Buffer Objects, shown below.
